Faint taps on a glass surface **thundered** in his eardrums as his name echoed all around him.

“Vihaan, wake up.” The taps grew harder. “Wake up.”

Vihaan felt his forehead hit something solid. When he opened his eyes, he found his face resting against the steering wheel.

He was still at Maya’s place.

“Vihaan, wake up,” Maya said, tapping on the fog-filled window beside his seat.

“Yes,” he groaned, rolling the window down.

“Check your phone,” she said. “There’s been an issue.”

He turned it on. Dozens of missed calls from his sister and brother-in-law flooded the screen, followed by a stream of messages. He skimmed the last few notifications.

_Where the fuck are you???_

_Call me_

_Harish—_

_HARISH IS DEAD!_

_Come fast._

Vihaan immediately yanked the handbrake up and started the engine. His fingers fumbled for his phone as he called Jyothi.

“I wanna come too,” Maya said, just as he was about to pull away.

Vihaan pressed the switch, unlocking the passenger door. He leaned across and pushed it open for her.

“Vihu! What the hell!!” Jyothi shouted through the phone, loud enough to startle Maya as she climbed in. “Where the fuck are you? We called you so many times!”

“I’m sorry,” Vihaan said, pulling onto the road. “I fell asleep.”

“What?”

“Doesn’t matter,” he said. “What happened? Harish died—how?”

There was a pause.

“Come here fast,” Jyothi said, her voice shaking. “He came to take his car back…” She sucked in a breath. “He fell into something and it exploded.”

Vihaan tightened his grip on the steering wheel.

“There’s so much fire and noise,” she cried. “Please come.”

"Coming," he said before he hung up.

"Let's go," Maya said, wrapping a shawl around her neck.

Vihaan hit the accelerator and rushed out of Maya's house.

Despite the rain, the fire was still burning.

The entire family had surrounded the ditch, looking at the smoke and fire emanating from it. Some locals were pouring water onto it to no avail, while the family mostly cried in panic.

As Vihaan pulled his car to the side of the ditch, he noticed that Malathi was there too.

She just stood there; she neither participated in the failed attempts to extinguish the fire nor joined the camp of sorrow. She had settled herself in solitude in front of the ditch, staring at her burning husband. Vihaan noticed a tear among the raindrops flowing down her face.

Maya and Vihaan got out of the car, neither of them bothering with an umbrella. Vihaan stood at one edge of the ditch, while Maya rushed toward Malathi, wrapping her arm around her in an attempt to comfort the recent widow.

"No," Malathi pushed Maya's arm away. "He is with Kesanna now. I should be happy."

She was crying.

Standing among the other locals, Vihaan started eavesdropping on their private whispers.

"Poor Malathi, she is so young," one said. "The baby too. She is going to have a hard time."

"No. She will be taken care of," another interjected. "Kesanna has chosen Harish; he will make sure the widow and the baby are taken care of."

"Yes," the other agreed. "Look at the fire, burning through the pouring rain. It is divine."

"Kesannana mahime," the locals chanted.

(_"Kesanna's miracle"_)

The localized chants were heard by others; some tried stopping it, but most just followed the worship.

"Kesannana mahime!" people screamed.

Malathi joined in too, a proud smile on her face. Maya stood silently beside Malathi, fixating her gaze on the recent widow.

She was horrified.

"Fire burning through the pouring rain," the words echoed in Vihaan's ears, invoking a faint thought from the past, now trying to chime into his conscious mind.

_Fire burning through the pouring rain,_ he told himself. _Fire burning through water._

_Oil burns._

Vihaan looked around the crowd, trying to find someone who might possess what he needed. His eyes finally rested on a local construction crew present among the chanting mob. He walked up to them and asked for their shovel. They just gestured toward it without paying much heed.

Vihaan went ahead and picked up the shovel.

"What are you doing?" a distinct voice tore through the crowd's chant.

It was Jyothi. She was beside Daniel, who was holding an umbrella for them both. Vihaan carried the shovel and walked toward his sister.

"Are you alright?" Jyothi interrogated. She was crying.

Vihaan noticed the genuine concern and worry in her question. _She is shook,_ he thought.

"I am alright," he answered. "I will be back. I think I know how to put the fire out," he said as he walked toward the ditch.

He stomped his feet to measure the dampness of the mud underneath, then took his shovel and dug it into the earth. He scooped up the mud and threw it toward the car. The fire diminished—not much, and not for long, yet enough for him to assess the practicality of his approach.

He did it again, and again. He turned toward the others and yelled at them, "Come on, we can extinguish the fire!"

No one complied. Most didn't even notice him.

"Bale ya poyi, thoo thekaga," a voice screamed from the distance.

(_"Come, let's extinguish the fire"_)

It was Keshav. He was standing among the busy crowd, and yet he was easy to spot. He had a shovel too. Vihaan was discomfited by his presence, but the feeling faded the moment others started joining the cause.

It took them some time, but they managed to extinguish the fire. In the end, all that was left was a blackened car drowned in a pool of dark brown mud.

As the last of the flames died, Vihaan climbed down into the ditch. His sandals sank into the mud and water pooling at the bottom. He waded toward the wreckage, heat still radiating from the blackened metal. The metal around the fuel tank had warped so completely he couldn't tell if it had ruptured or if something else had fed the flames.

He kept wondering if the car's fuel or engine oil was sufficient to engulf the vehicle in such an unending pool of fire. Vihaan observed the pile of immolated automobile; everything that wasn't hard metal had dissolved from existence.

Beneath the dark, blistered shell of metal, something held its shape. A curve where a shoulder should have been. A bend that resembled knees drawn toward the dashboard.

Vihaan stared longer than he should have. He told himself it was just wreckage. Just heat-twisted metal.

It was Harish. Sitting in his seat, now nothing but a piece of black charcoal.

"Kesanna has taken one of his foremost devotees into his arms. Everyone rejoice," someone from the crowd announced.

---

The sound of sirens echoed throughout the place; the fire brigade, an ambulance, and even the police had surrounded the area.

Vihaan stood just outside the Dombottu house. The sirens were too loud and the lights hurt his eyes. The smell of burnt oil still clung to the air. And yet, he stayed where he was.

Maya was escorting Malathi to a seat on the long, narrow porch. Jyothi and Daniel were talking to others; Daniel did most of the talking while Jyothi just stood there, looking terrified.

Vihaan let his eyes wander, finally fixating on the stairs leading to one of the four entrances of the house. There was someone familiar sitting on those stairs, unmoved by the noise.

It was Shekar.

He looked submerged in himself. His eyes showed dried tears, and a grey stubble covered his otherwise clean-shaven cheeks. _He looks at least a decade older,_ Vihaan thought.

Vihaan slowly walked up to him, each step a moment of consideration. He sat beside Shekar, who didn't even flinch to acknowledge his wife's nephew.

Vihaan exhaled. "I am sorry about Harish," he mumbled. "He was a good man."

Shekar did not say anything, at least for a good while.

"Why didn't you say anything?" Shekar finally said, without looking at him. "I know you were there when I spoke to the Patri."

"You knew?" Vihaan was startled, almost at a loss for words by the sudden reveal.

"Yes," Shekar answered. "Almost immediately. But what would I have even done? You had already seen me."

"So why didn't you tell anyone, even when you knew?"

"I wanted to," Vihaan confessed. "But Danny stopped me. He thought it was best for Jyothi not to inherit Dombottu."

"Then he is a smarter man than I am," Shekar quietly remarked. "No one has any choice now, do they?"

Vihaan didn't say anything, only sighed. Shekar then looked at him.

"I am sorry for whatever I said about your sister. I did not mean it," he confessed. "Jyothi has always been my favorite among you kids. Even now. But Malathi is my daughter," he added. "I just wanted her to have a better life. She stayed here; I believed she deserved this village. I did not even believe in all this stuff," he continued. "I thought Kesanna was a farce. I am responsible for this, Vihaan," he cried, letting his shoulders collapse. "I... I destroyed my own daughter’s happiness."

Vihaan extended his hand with the intention of comforting his uncle but quickly pulled it back. He did not know what to say. He did not know if there was anything to say.

---

The elders agreed to host Harish's funeral that same evening. Vihaan found it a bit unconventional, especially considering the weather and the odd time, but he did not question it.

"Kesanna needs him as soon as possible," one of the elders said.

Malathi was stripped of her bangles, sindoor, rings, and other jewelry. But she refused to give up her Mangalsutra. Some elders protested, but none of the family did.

Malathi did not cry, even when her husband's corpse was laid in front of her. Charred and rotten, it was stripped of any flesh or resemblance to the man he once was. Even then, Malathi did not cry.

"I hope he looks better when he meets Kesanna," she joked once, but no one apart from her laughed.

Since Harish was an orphan, Shekar was the one asked to light his pyre. He wept his way to the pyre, trembling and unable to carry the burning torch, yet no one stepped forward to help him. A part of Vihaan wanted to help the man, but he convinced himself it wasn't his place.

Many villagers gathered for Harish's funeral despite the short notice. For a moment, Vihaan felt the number exceeded the attendance at Baby's funeral.

Shekar almost dropped the fiery torch at his feet, but ultimately managed to light his son-in-law's pyre. Vihaan watched it burn—his second fire in a single day.

This time it was different; the fire was colder, and yet it burned brighter. The color contrasted perfectly with its dark surroundings. For a single moment, the warmth and the light made Vihaan forget the occasion, letting him stand there to admire the grim beauty of the immolated pyre.

As Vihaan kept his eyes fixed on the flaming wood, he saw something appear just behind it. He did not notice it initially, but once he did, he saw an outline, and slowly colors started filling it in. It took the shape of a man with brown skin and black hair. His face was obstructed by the moving flames, but once Vihaan moved closer, he felt his heart skip a beat.

It was Harish. Standing behind his own pyre.

"Kesannana Mahime," the crowd started chanting.

(_"Kesanna's Miracle"_)
