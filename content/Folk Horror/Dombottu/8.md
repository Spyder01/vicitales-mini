There was an atmosphere of silent noise that persisted across the Dombottu house as people visited one after another. Some were comforting, and some needed to be comforted.

Vihaan and Maya stepped out of the house to avoid contributing to the already overcrowded space.

"You okay?" Maya asked.

"Yes," Vihaan said. "A little sad. Maybe it hasn't kicked in yet."

Maya silently nodded. Vihaan looked at her.

"Thank you for what you did for her," Vihaan told Maya as they both stood outside facing the veranda.

"It's okay. It felt right," Maya replied. "She was quite a woman."

"She was," Vihaan said.

Maya hesitated, then added, “Years ago, after her brothers died, she came to Mumbai to meet my grandmother. She wanted to give Dombottu back.”

“Dhodda said no,” she continued. “She told her, ‘I will accept it if you give me back everything you took from me. Can you return my son?’”

Vihaan chuckled.

"These old folks are very dramatic," he commented.

"That they are," Maya agreed with a chuckle of her own.

Vihaan then walked out to help the rest of the family with his grandmother's last rites.

---

Within the next two hours, the rituals started. Baby was stripped of her nightgown by her daughters-in-law, and her daughters made sure to remove every piece of jewelry.

Malathi prepared the hot water in which Baby was bathed. Everyone had to contribute to bathing her—the entire family. Some cried; some did not. Vihaan wanted to, but he could not, no matter how much he tried.

Baby was then dressed in one of her most prized sarees. They also brought her some flowers. No jewelry, though.

As she was being taken to the pyre, Vihaan found Harish there. He approached him.

"How are you?" Vihaan asked.

"I am fine," Harish gave him a small, obligatory smile. "Thanks for asking."

Vihaan opened his mouth but reconsidered before the words could come out.

Keshav was the one who lit the pyre. The elders had been wary of an outdoor funeral—rain was always a possibility—but it did not come. The fire caught the cloth first, then the wood followed. As the flames grew, the heat struck Vihaan’s face—first warmth, then smoke, then the smell.

He kept his eyes fixed on the body lying in the fire. He wanted to see. The skin tightened and blackened, curling inward as it burned, brittle like paper. Smoke thickened from gray to black, slapping against his face until he could no longer see her at all.

When the fire had done its duty, all that remained was ash and dust. Vihaan felt something moist drip from his eyes. It was just a drop, perhaps two.

_It's the smoke,_ he told himself. _Just the smoke._

Once the fire faded and the smoke vanished, the men started leaving. First the outsiders, then the family. Vihaan turned his back toward the pyre and was about to leave when he noticed a familiar thin frame standing at a distance.

It was Shekar.

He was standing there alone. Some noticed him, but no one approached him. Vihaan just stood in place and stared at his uncle, whose eyes were fixed on the pyre. He was crying, his eyes filled with tears, and his hands were clenched together. Vihaan noticed his mouth move, ever so slightly.

Vihaan exhaled. He walked away, too.

"I will get the lawyers tomorrow," Keshav told Jyothi. "There are some legal formalities, but I will have them handled for you."

"You sure it should all come to me?" she questioned her uncle. "With whatever happened last night?"

"Dombottu is yours," Keshav said, his eyes still red. "By Kesanna's grace, I hope you fulfill your duties well."

"I apologize for whatever happened yesterday," he added. "I will talk to Shekar and see that it won't be repeated."

"It's okay, Maama," Jyothi responded. "Chikkappa is already going through a lot. Let him be."

Vihaan and Daniel were standing together at a distance, observing the interaction between Keshav and Jyothi.

"Did you tell her?" Vihaan inquired of Daniel. "That you knew about Shekar's plan."

"No," Daniel said. "I did not want to complicate things for her."

"Okay," Vihaan said.

"You should tell her, you know," Vihaan continued after a pause. "That you don't want this."

Daniel stayed silent. He pulled out a pair of areca nuts and began fidgeting with them.

“Your sister,” he said finally, “she has that fire in her. A spark that lights up her whole face.” He paused. “I love that about her.”

Daniel looked down. “I don’t want to be the reason she loses it,” he said. “So I’ll stand with her until the end—” a breath “—even if it burns me.”

“Is this how you bagged my sister?” Vihaan chuckled. “By showering her with cheesy lines?”

Daniel pointed past him. Jyothi was walking toward them.

“It worked,” he said. “Didn’t it?”

“My dear boys, what’s happening?” Jyothi asked, approaching them. “What are you both discussing?”

“I was just telling him,” Daniel said easily, “that his sister is the most beautiful woman out there.” He leaned in and kissed her cheek.

Vihaan startled at the display—so open, so unbothered by the conservative eyes watching them. And yet, he couldn't help but smile. He turned and began to walk away.

“Where are you going?” Jyothi called, clinging to Daniel’s arm.

"I am going to drop Maya at her place," he answered.

Jyothi and Daniel looked at each other and shared a quiet chuckle before turning back to him.

“What?” Vihaan asked.

“Nothing,” Jyothi said, smiling. “Don’t be late.”

---

"Oh, no. I do not want to bother you," Maya told Vihaan. "Not at this time."

"You aren't," he said. "You are doing me a favor, actually."

She hesitated. “Are you sure your family doesn’t need you? I don’t want to take you away from them.”

He smiled just a little. “They’ll manage,” he said. “Besides—” a pause “—I could use the company.”

She smiled.

"I spoke to Harish," Vihaan told Maya as he was fastening his seatbelt. "He looked surprisingly alright."

"Is that so?" Maya commented. "Malathi did not seem particularly withdrawn either, although she did not speak much."

"Do you really think he is going to die?" Vihaan questioned. "What if we send him out—"

Vihaan was cut off by a knock on his window. It was Harish. Vihaan rolled the window down.

“Hey.”

“Hey,” Harish said. Malathi stood beside him, one hand resting against her belly. He hesitated, then smiled faintly. “Would you mind giving us a drop? It’s on the way.”

Malathi added softly, “The car’s been acting up since morning.”

Vihaan stared at them for a moment, the words not quite registering. Then it hit him.

“Oh—yeah. Of course,” he said quickly. “No trouble at all.” He reached across and unlocked the doors. “Please, get in.”

Harish nodded. “Thanks.”

For a moment, no one spoke. The engine hummed. The road stretched ahead. And between them sat everything they weren't saying.

As they hit the road, Vihaan noticed his cousin and her husband holding each other's hands. They were murmuring to each other, giggling. The sight confused him. He looked at Maya, who was sitting in the passenger seat. They shared a gaze full of unanswered questions, neither knowing how to navigate it.

"You can ask," Harish said. "I know you both want to."

"How are you so calm?" Vihaan asked. The words came out sharper than intended. "You have a month."

In the rearview mirror, Harish's smile didn't fade.

"Maybe less," Maya chimed in. "Could be tomorrow. Could be the last day. No one knows."

"Doesn't that terrify you?"

Harish glanced at Malathi, their hands still intertwined. "It did," he said. "For a few moments. Then I realized there is nothing to be afraid of. It's a blessing."

Vihaan and Maya looked at each other, shocked. He tightened his grip on the steering wheel.

"A blessing?" he repeated. "How is dying a blessing?"

Harish did not answer right away. The road curved gently, and he with it.

"I used to always pray to Kesanna for a meaning, a purpose, especially after my parents died," he said. "He did not say anything until last night."

Malathi’s thumb brushed over his knuckles. Once. Twice.

"I am picked by Kesanna," he continued. "That is the greatest thing that ever happened to me."

Maya shifted in her seat, turning her head back to face Harish. "What about Malathi? What about your baby?"

"I will be fine," Malathi said. Her voice was calm—too calm. "I will miss him, of course. But that means nothing compared to the joy and pride I would feel knowing that my husband is with Kesanna."

“He will grow with faith,” she said. Harish met Vihaan’s eyes in the mirror. “Just like his father.”

---

Neither Vihaan nor Maya dared to utter a word until they reached Harish and Malathi's home.

"Come, have some tea," Harish invited them in.

"No, she is getting late," Vihaan said, pointing at Maya, who instantly nodded in agreement.

Harish chuckled. "Okay, see you man," Harish extended a hand. "Maybe I will drop by later to pick up the car."

Vihaan shook his hand. "Sure," he said, and nothing more.

The drive resumed in silence. The village lights thinned out quickly, swallowed by the curve of the road, and the rubber trees stood tall, observing Vihaan and Maya in complete silence like a bunch of spymasters.

Maya sat with her hands folded in her lap, her thumbs brushing against each other over and over. Vihaan kept his eyes on the road. For a while, neither of them tried to speak. It was Maya who broke first.

“Do you believe him?” she asked softly, not looking at him.

Vihaan exhaled through his nose. “I don’t know what to believe anymore.”

She nodded, as if that answer was expected.

"I keep thinking about Malathi," Maya said. "How calm she was."

“That wasn’t calm,” Vihaan replied. “That was… surrender.”

Maya turned toward him then. “Or faith.”

He tightened his grip on the steering wheel. “Is there a difference?”

She didn’t answer.

"Do you think he will die?" Vihaan asked. "I mean, he is young and healthy. This is new, right? Someone non-obvious got picked. Maybe..." he added, "...maybe it was a mistake."

Maya didn't reply immediately. The road narrowed, the rubber trees pressing closer, their shadows stretching and retreating as the headlights passed. Slowly, tiny droplets of water started covering the windshield. It started raining.

Maya spoke. "But Santhosh Maama died," she mentioned. "He was young. Healthy. Picked by Kesanna."

Vihaan felt something hit him straight in the center of his chest. Something pressing hard to tear apart his ribs and get inside. A burst of unwanted emotions and memories attacked his head. He had been there that night.

_Should I tell her?_ he thought.

He opened his mouth but closed it the moment he saw her speak.

"You know, I hated you for a while," she said. "I know it wasn't your fault. But you were the one who found him."

Vihaan gasped for air.

"For some reason, I felt if you hadn't found him that day, he would be alive," she added. "I know it was completely stupid. But that is what I thought."

"What changed after?" Vihaan asked.

"I started missing you..." a pause. "Jyothi, too. I realized I was more angry that you all left," she added. "It gets lonely here. At Dombottu."

Vihaan hesitated before he spoke, wondering if he should tell her the truth which, a few minutes ago, he had deemed insignificant enough even to remember.

_She deserves to know,_ he thought. _She loved him._

"I am sorry," he said. Nothing more.

"Oh, come on, don't be stupid," Maya said. "It was not your fault."

"Yes," Vihaan replied. "Yes, it wasn't."

---

"Come in," Maya told Vihaan. "I will make you a cup of coffee. Black," she added.

"Oh, no, no," he replied. "I shouldn't. You've had a long night. Also, I need to sleep. Coffee wouldn't let me."

"Kokum juice then. Get in," she said with a subtle, mischievous smile. "And I am not asking. You know the rule."

Vihaan complied. Sundari and Ravi weren't home when they entered. Vihaan stood outside facing the trees.

There he was. The boy.

He was circumambulating the house. Vihaan had been intrigued by the act since the Kola was over, and this time there was no one else with him. Vihaan couldn't see his face; the details were blurred, and his eyes were covered by an ugly black umbrella.

Vihaan opened his own umbrella and stepped out of the house, slowly walking toward the boy who seemed overtly focused on the mundane task he performed. As Vihaan approached, the details that made up the boy grew blurrier. The sharp edges dissolved, the colors started mixing, and he began to fade away.

"Vihaan," Maya called him from the house. "Come. The juice is ready."

The boy was gone.

"Why were you out there in the rain?" Maya inquired.

Vihaan turned his back, confirming the absence of the boy. "Nothing," he said. "Thought I saw something. Maybe I need some sleep."

"Maybe?" Maya handed him the kokum juice.

Both Vihaan and Maya sat on the couch—he taking tiny sips of the juice and she carrying the tray on her lap, staring at him as if expecting him to say something.

"It's good," Vihaan said, raising his glass. "I really like it."

"Thank you," Maya smiled and leaned back on the couch.

Vihaan took more sips, sometimes gargling the juice inside his mouth before swallowing. He wanted to make it last longer. Once he was finished, he placed the cup on the table.

"Thanks. I have to go," he said, but Maya had dozed off in her place.

He stood from the couch and had a long look at Maya. She had fallen asleep with the tray still on her lap, sitting in an awkward position. He hesitated, considering and reconsidering his thoughts, ultimately giving up on the process.

_Fuck it,_ he told himself.

He went to her and gently lifted her legs, placing them on the couch before setting down a pillow to support her neck. He then smiled as he walked out of her house.
