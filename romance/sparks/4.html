      <p><strong>&quot;Are those boobies?!&quot;</strong> Ollie gasped, eyes wide, utterly transfixed by Jack’s sketch of the French lady on the screen.</p>
<p>The illusion that had held Claudia to the story—and Garry to Claudia—snapped like a rubber band. Without thinking, Claudia reached out and clamped a hand over Ollie’s eyes.</p>
<p>“It’s art, Ollie. It’s art,” Garry chuckled, amused at the chaos.</p>
<p>Claudia shot him a sharp side-eye. He raised both hands in mock surrender, but then, in solidarity, leaned over to cover Thea’s eyes too.</p>
<p>Thea batted his hand away without looking. “Nothing I haven’t seen, Uncle Garry.”</p>
<p>Claudia blinked at the little girl, part scandalised, part impressed, &quot;Definitely skipping this scene.&quot;</p>
<p>Claudia reached for the remote, but Garry held her hand to prevent that from happening.</p>
<p>Claudia's heart skipped a beat.</p>
<p>&quot;Too late, Ms. Shepard,&quot; Garry stated pointing at the screen, &quot;The damage has already done.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You err-a-are enjoying this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Immensely,&quot; Garry blurted with a mischievous smile on his face.</p>
<p>Garry let go, but Claudia’s hand still tingled.</p>
<p><em>'Few moments more, please.'</em> her mind screamed, no matter how much she tried for it not to.</p>
<p>She didn’t move it right away—didn’t reach for the remote again either. For a few seconds, they just sat there in that silence, watching the characters on screen, but not really <em>seeing</em> them.</p>
<p>Her hand lowered slowly, resting between the couch cushions—only for Garry’s to settle there again moments later.</p>
<p>Their fingers brushed.</p>
<p>Paused.</p>
<p>Neither pulled away this time.</p>
<p>From the corner of her eye, Claudia could see him breathing slower. As if trying to match her rhythm. As if trying not to disturb whatever it was.</p>
<p>Claudia placed her hand upon his. It felt good, it was surreal yet comforting in a serene way. She moved her thumb, slowly rubbing it in circles across his. She liked it, the warmth, the calm, and most especially how she felt his sight on her even without looking.</p>
<p>'I want to fly!!!' yelled Thea just as Jack started singing &quot;Come Josephine, my flying machine&quot; in Rose's ears.</p>
<p>Claudia pulled her hand in a flash, but Garry's stayed. He rolled his eyes, and then closed it. He sighed.</p>
<p><em>'Just a while longer, please.'</em></p>
<p>&quot;I want to fly, Uncle Garry,&quot; Thea screamed yet again.</p>
<p>&quot;Fly, fly, fly, fly, FLLLLLLYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!&quot; Ollie followed.</p>
<p>&quot;Sure, my darling Rose,&quot; Garry said and picked Thea up in the air.</p>
<p>Claudia smiled and rewinded the movie to their intended scene.</p>
<p>As the music swelled, Garry lifted Thea high into the air, her laughter ringing out like a bell. He twirled her around with the grace of a dance, her little arms stretched wide like wings.</p>
<p>'I am flying,' screamed Thea amidst the bursts of laughter, 'Jack, I am flying.'</p>
<p>When Rose stretched her neck and kissed Jack, Garry brought Thea down and kissed her in the forehead.</p>
<p>'Here, my little Rose.'</p>
<p>When Garry dropped Thea down, and fixed his hair all the while himself laughing, he turned toward Claudia who had her eyes fixed at him with her face carrying a smile that was as comforting as it was wide.</p>
<p>'Now who is staring at whom, Ms. Shepard?' Garry pointed out.</p>
<p>Claudia blinked. &quot;I was... Err..It was just-&quot; then submitting to the truth, &quot;-It was nice. I like how you are with the kids.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now you both do it!&quot; Thea screamed.</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot; Garry exclaimed.</p>
<p>&quot;You both do it,&quot; she repeated, &quot;You will be the Jack and Ms. Shepard will be the Rose.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, we can't do it, love.&quot; Claudia remarked.</p>
<p>&quot;Why can't you? Please do it...&quot; Thea joined her palms together, &quot;It will be more authentic.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Please, please, please...&quot; Thea started chanted which was joined by Ollie.</p>
<p>Garry and Claudia looked at each other. A little reluctance, a little confusion in their eyes, but there was something more, something both couldn't decipher.</p>
<p>&quot;I am ready if you are,&quot; Garry said, his voice softer than before—almost careful. He raised his hand toward Claudia.</p>
<p><em>Oh, lord! Please let her hold it.</em> His inner voice screaming with an yearning that started oozing out of his eyes.</p>
<p>Claudia gave a subtle smile and blinked in agreement.</p>
<p>Garry smiled with a relief of being freed from weight of million boulder.</p>
<p>&quot;Do not drop me,&quot; Claudia chortled as she places her hand on Garry's.</p>
<p>&quot;I wouldn't dare,&quot; Garry murmured as he led her to the middle of the room.</p>
<p>&quot;On the sofa!!!&quot; Thea demanded, &quot;It will actually be like a ship.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's ridiculous,&quot; Claudia commented, giving a pause for a thought, &quot;But whatever, let's do it.&quot;</p>
<p>Garry climbed the couch, turning toward Claudia he bowed and offered his hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Welcome aboard, milady.&quot;</p>
<p>Claudia bit her lip to keep from grinning too wide. Her face flushed, and unable keep herself composed, oozed out her feelings in a form of deliberate laughter.</p>
<p>'Come on,' said she while rolling her eyes, she slapped his hand away, but when Garry pulled his hand back, she instinctively held it by the wrist.</p>
<p>He looked at his wrist and then her eyes, waiting, reading and searching, not being aware of what exactly but...something.</p>
<p>Their laughter dimmed, being replaced by something more subtle, something without a dime or a reason yet with a purpose that couldn't be defined by the mortal verse. Claudia's fingers, curled around his wrist, loosened slightly, yet refusing to let go.</p>
<p>&quot;I am sorry, I didn't mean to hit you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know,&quot; he replied as he held her forearm, &quot;Now close your eyes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Huh?!&quot; Claudia was confused, but them in the background a faint voice from Leo DiCaprio spoke.</p>
<p>&quot;Close your eyes.&quot;</p>
<p>Claudia let out a chuckle, &quot;You want me to-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just close it.&quot;</p>
<p>She hesitated for the briefest second, then sighed, smiling softly to herself as her eyelids fluttered shut.</p>
<p>He gently pulled her upon the couch, and freed himself from her grasp. She sighed, but then her heart skipped a beat when he slowly crawled his fingers over the tip of wrists.</p>
<p>Celine Dion's voice tender was building up the &quot;My Heart Will go On&quot; and Leo's voice was echoing throughout the room, and yet Claudia heard nothing, all she could hear and all she could feel were Garry's warm breath hitting the slope of her shoulders.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you trust me?&quot; his whispers echoes through her ears.</p>
<p>Claudia swallowed. Her breath caught in her throat as she tried to answer, but her voice refused to come. Instead, she nodded slowly—eyes still closed, lashes damp with the weight of the moment.</p>
<p>Garry slid his hands to the surface of her palms, holding it gently he lift her arms up. She clenched her hands, making it a fist and entrapping his fingers in.</p>
<p>&quot;HaaaaH!!&quot; a prolonged yet warm breath came out of Garry, hitting Claudia's and making her slightly move her head over his chest with her cheeks hitting the buttons of his shirt.</p>
<p>He didn't want to let her go, he closed his eyes and let himself sink in the smell of her hair.</p>
<p><em>Lavenders,</em> he muttered to himself, his heart was erratic in its rhythm which he hoped that she did not hear.</p>
<p>&quot;It is beautiful, isn't it?&quot; Thea exclaimed looking at her uncle and babysitter.</p>
<p>&quot;If you say so,&quot; Ollie replied.</p>
<p>&quot;Open your eyes,&quot; Garry tried his best to follow the script.</p>
<p>Claudia opened her eyes, and muttered in a barely legible language, &quot;I am flying..Jack. I'm flying.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are too close,&quot; she whispered in Garry's ears.</p>
<p>&quot;I will leave, if you ask me to.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't leave,&quot; she bleated, instinctively.</p>
<p>Garry didn't answer her.</p>
<p>He didn't need to.</p>
<p>Instead, he let her head rest against hers, their breath mingled, now almost forming their own unique rhythm that complemented the gradually building Titanic theme in the background. Garry slowly brought their hands down, wrapped it around her waist.</p>
<p>She felt him. The cold surface of his left thumb scrapping over the thin gap between where her shirt shirt ended and jeans began. They were close, but she felt him getting closer. She turned her head towards him and both moved towards each other, almost meeting their lips.</p>
<p>&quot;Garry,&quot; she said in a silent whisper that blended a cocktail of disappointment and yearning, &quot;I think we-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;--should stop,&quot; Garry concluded her sentence.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she agreed, &quot;Kids.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hmm, yep. Always the kids,&quot; he said as he loosened his grip around her.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;What the hell is happening here?!?!&quot;</strong> A voice boomed from their behind, startling everyone with Claudia almost falling off of the couch, she would have if not for Ollie.</p>
<p>&quot;Mommy!!!&quot; the kids screamed and ran toward their parents.</p>
<p>Elena Ryes stood there near the door flabbergasted with a sliver of curious mischief that came with her subtle smirk, whereas her darling husbandDaniel stood there, already burst into laughter.</p>
